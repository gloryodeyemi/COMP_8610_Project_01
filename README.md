# Supervised Model for Predicting Default of Credit Card Clients
The goal of this experiment is to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict the deafault of credit card clients.

**Keywords:** DNN, MLP, Supervised model, Prediction

## The Data
We used the [default of credit card clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) dataset, a case of customers default payment in Taiwan, from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). It has 24 attributes (number of columns) and 30000 instances (number of rows).
